The server is implemented using [Node.js] and [Express], along with [MongoDB] as
the database.

The frontend uses the [Bulma.io] CSS framework along with [JQuery]. Fuzzy search
functionality is provided by the [Fuse.js] library. The project uses [Pug],
[SCSS] and [Webpack] to build the frontend assets.
